# Custom-Lexical-Analyzer-for-the-Python-Language

A lexical analyzer is an integral component of a compiler or interpreter that scans the input source
code and breaks it down into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the basic building blocks of a
programming language, including keywords, identifiers, strings, operators, numbers, and
punctuation symbols. The primary goal of a lexical analyzer is to simplify the job of the parser by
reducing the complexity of the input source code. This paper discusses the concept of lexical
analyzers and their importance in the compilation process. It also outlines the three essential terms
in a lexical analyzer, namely lexemes, tokens, and patterns, and the methods used to implement
them. Additionally, it highlights the broader applications of lexical analyzers in text processing,
such as natural language processing, data mining, and information retrieval.
